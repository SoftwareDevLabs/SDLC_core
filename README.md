## 🔧 Key Components

```

📁 config/ → YAML config for models, prompts, logging
📁 data/ → Prompts, embeddings, and other dynamic content
📁 examples/ → Minimal scripts to test key features
📁 notebooks/ → Quick experiments and prototyping
📁 tests/ → Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
📁 src/ → The core engine — all logic lives here (./src/README.md)

```
---

## ⚡ Best Practices

- Track prompt versions and results  
- Separate configs using YAML files
- Maintain separation between model clients
- Structure code by clear module boundaries  
- Cache responses to reduce latency and cost  
- Handle errors with custom exceptions  
- Use notebooks for rapid testing and iteration  
- Monitor API usage and set rate limits  
- Keep code and docs in sync  

---

## 🧭 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo  
2. Install via `requirements.txt`  
3. Set up model configs  
4. Check sample code  
5. Begin in notebooks  

---

## 💡 Development Tips

- Use modular structure  
- Test components early  
- Track with version control  
- Keep datasets fresh  
- Keep documentation updated
- Monitor API usage and limits

## 📁 Core Files

- `requirements.txt` – Package dependencies  
- `README.md` – Project overview and usage  
- `Dockerfile` – Container build instructions  

## Running tests

We provide a small helper script that creates an isolated virtualenv and runs the test suite.

Run the full test suite locally:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

Or run just the deepagent tests (fast):

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh test/unit -k deepagent
```

You can also use the Makefile targets:

```bash
make test
make lint
```

## Contributing

We are excited to work alongside you, our amazing community, to build and
enhance Windows Terminal\!

***BEFORE you start work on a feature/fix***, please read & follow our [Contributor's Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to
help avoid any wasted or duplicate effort.

## Communicating with the Team

The easiest way to communicate with the team is via GitHub issues.

Please file new issues, feature requests and suggestions, but **DO search for similar open/closed preexisting issues before creating a new issue.**

If you would like to ask a question that you feel doesn't warrant an issue (yet), please reach out to us via Twitter:

* contact [info@softwaredevlabs.com][conduct-email]

### Coding Guidance

Please review these brief docs below about our coding practices.

> 👉 If you find something missing from these docs, feel free to contribute to
> any of our documentation files anywhere in the repository (or write some new
> ones!)

This is a work in progress as we learn what we'll need to provide people in
order to be effective contributors to our project.
